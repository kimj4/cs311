1. names of project members
Ju Yun Kim, Dmitry Tensyn

2. if solo, then the reason for being solo
N/A

3. topic
Physics Engines

4. what software the project will use, usually including an OpenGL version number and why that version is 	   adequate/necessary
	=== libraries ===
	- Given: ODE: Open Dynamics Engine
	- look into later: Open Source Physics
	- Bullet Physics Library (might be an engine)
		- (documentation?) http://bulletphysics.org/Bullet/BulletFull/index.html
	- ReactPhysics3D
		- (user manual) http://www.reactphysics3d.com/documentation/manual/ReactPhysics3D-UserManual.pdf
	- physx (needs registration)
	- havok (probably an engine)
	- RandyGaul/qu3e (ver 1.01) (https://github.com/RandyGaul/qu3e)		

5. whether the software works on our lab machines; if not, then a plan for how the project can happen
   if other people's software is being used, then an explanation of how the students will demonstrate that they understand the project, rather than treating the software as a "black box" that does the project for them

- compatibility is probably okay. If software doesn't work on lab machines, we have computers that run all 	three OSs so that's fine

- how to learn material?
	- choose an open source lib
	- maybe make variations of certain functions in the library and demonstrate what happens
	- make several demos that demonstrate physical+graphical concepts
	- in our presentations talk about how certain things are implemented high level
		 - sort of like lighting (we are not modeling ambient light super accurately)
